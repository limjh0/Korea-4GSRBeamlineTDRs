2. Scientific Objective
=======================
The BioPharma-BioSAXS beamline provides a solution SXAS technique, contributing to the analysis of biopharmaceutical properties by studying the three-dimensional structure and structural transition of solution-phase biological molecules and their complexes. Examples of applications using the solution SAXS technique are as follows: (1) Quantitatively characterize the structure of multi-domain proteins linked by flexible linkers and intrinsically disordered proteins.[5-8] (2) Reveal the structural behavior and stability of proteins and protein drugs through understanding the structure of the native and denatured states of proteins.[9-11] (3) Recently, mRNA vaccines and treatments have been in the spotlight, and lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are being used as an effective mRNA delivery system, and the structural stability of mRNA-LNPs in solution is being studied.[12, 13] (4) Real-time SEC-SAXS technique is used to study the change in solution phase structure of monodisperse biopolymer materials through separation/purification.[14] To facilitate such research, a collimated beam with high beam flux must be irradiated onto the sample. Varying the SDD is essential due to the diversity of samples to be measured and the need for a wide q range. A variable q range vacuum chamber will be built for fast and precise SDD change (0.5 - 6 m). By introducing an automatic sample changer at a fixed sample environment location, large number of samples can be processed at high speed to collect data at high throughput.
