**2.2.7 Real-time X-ray Absorption Fine Structure Beamline**

**1. Introduction**

The Real-time X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (RXAFS) beamline is a
state-of-the-art tool specifically designed for X-ray absorption and
emission spectroscopy. It will be situated at the ID23 section of the
Korea-4GSR and will utilize an in-vacuum undulator as its light source.
This advanced beamline will produce highly focused and intense X-ray
beams across a wide energy range, derived from electron beams with a low
emittance of about 60 pmÂ·rad. Through offering X-ray Absorption
Spectroscopy (XAS), electronic and local structures can be unveiled by
exciting core electrons to unoccupied orbitals with an external X-ray
that matches the corresponding edges' energy.

The primary experimental technique of the RXAFS beamline is Quick X-ray
Absorption Spectroscopy (QXAS), which enables XAS measurements on a
millisecond time scale. QXAS can be utilized to study various chemical
reaction mechanisms, including the redox processes of battery materials
during charging and discharging, intermediates in catalytic reactions,
and phase transition processes in novel materials. Additionally, the
RXAFS beamline will support X-ray Emission Spectroscopy (XES), providing
in-depth insights into the electronic structure of occupied states in
novel and advanced materials using a variety of analyzer crystals and a
position-sensitive detector.

By delivering both QXAFS and XES, the RXAFS beamline is poised to play a
pivotal role in various advanced material sciences, such as batteries,
catalysts, and biomedicines, and is expected to open up new frontiers in
research.

XAS, an experimental method for gathering data on X-ray intensity before
and after it passes through a material sample, is a versatile tool that
inspires with its potential. This data is then used to apply the
Beer-Lambert law, enabling the determination and analysis of the
sample's X-ray attenuation coefficient. The energy of the absorption
edge, which varies depending on the element type, allows for the
selective analysis of elements using XAS. This versatility means that
even if a sample contains a variety of elements, it is possible to
obtain individual local structure information for a specific element.
Furthermore, XAS is a versatile analysis technique that is not limited
by the presence or absence of crystallinity or the shape of a sample, as
it can observe the local structure around a specific element within a
few angstroms. This versatility is crucial in the development of various
advanced materials, including secondary batteries, catalysts,
semiconductor materials, and solar cells. In the RXAFS beamline, XAS is
a fundamental technique that supports its normal operation with a
user-friendly measurement method.
