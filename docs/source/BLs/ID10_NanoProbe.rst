``ID10`` NanoProbe
=================================

Scientific Objective
--------------------

The nanoprobe beamline provides a nano-beam smaller than 50 nm in the
hard X-ray energy range of 5 to 25 keV. This beam size of 50 nm allows
for quantitative nanoscale analysis of the element distribution and
quantity of materials in localized regions. The energy range of 5 to 25
keV enables quantitative nano-spectroscopy for most transition metals
and rare earth metals. Additionally, the high penetration power of hard
X-rays can pass through gas environments and windows required for
maintaining these environments, allowing for the study of materials
under actual synthesis and operating conditions. To facilitate such
research, the nanoprobe beamline is designed to provide a long working
distance of 50 mm despite the small beam size in the tens of nanometer
range. This makes it easy to insert devices that offer various
conditions, such as high and low temperature, gas environments, liquid
environment sample delivery, and the application of electric or magnetic
fields, enabling in-situ/operando materials research. The scientific
focus of the nanoprobe is on tracking the reactions and defect growth
processes of battery and catalyst systems, or the quantitative nanoscale
analysis of complex functional materials and material systems in actual
manufacturing and operating environments. Furthermore, to accommodate
the trend of larger systems for improved reactivity or performance, a
high-speed precision nano-stage has been introduced, allowing for the
investigation of a wider area at the nanoscale. The measurement
equipment includes X-ray fluorescence detectors and signal detectors,
providing quantitative simultaneous information on the electron density,
strain, and element distribution of the sample, with all measurements
designed to be studied in three dimensions.

Beamline requirements for the Insertion Devices (IDs)
-----------------------------------------------------

The nanoprobe beamline provides an energy range of 5-25 keV using an
In-Vacuum Undulator(IVU). IDs of Nanoprobe are designed to give the
highest brilliance in this range without losing energy continuity. The
parameters for the IDs are detailed in the table below. The maximum
power represents the maximum beam power passing through a mask with a 2
x 2 mm² opening @ 23 m under the maximum current conditions(400 mA) of
the currently planned storage ring.

+---------+---------+---------+--------------------+--------+--------+

Beamline requirements for the Front End (FE)
--------------------------------------------

The FE of the nanoprobe beamline is required to 1) handle a 17 kW heat
load, 2) beam position diagnostics, and 3) radiation safety. First, the
17 kW total beam power generated by the IDs is managed using three masks
with water cooled channels. Two of these masks are 'Movable masks' with
adjustable gap sizes and positions, while the third is a 'Fixed mask'
with a fixed aperture size in horizontal direction that can only have
its position adjusted. For detailed specifications of the masks, refer
to Chapter []. Note that although the nanoprobe's IDs have a minimum gap
of 5 mm, the effective minimum gap required to provide the 5-25 keV
range is 6 mm. Consequently, the maximum total power that can be
generated by the nanoprobe IDs is 12 kW. Secondly, the FE includes an
X-ray beam position diagnostic device. In the first phase, the
diagnostic X-ray beam position will be used to provide feedback for slit
and optics positions, ensuring the stability of the beam position
delivered to the sample within < 10% of the beam size. In the mature
phase, the diagnostic X-ray beam position will also be integrated with
the electron beam feedback system to enhance performance. For detailed
specifications of the diagnostic device, refer to Chapter []. Lastly,
the FE is equipped with safety devices to protect against gamma
radiation and electron beam insertion in FE. Specifically, a safety
magnet with an approximate strength of 0.5 T is installed to handle
scenarios where the electron beam enters the FE. This ensures that any
electron beam inserted into the FE is deflected horizontally and
prevented from reaching the optical hutch.

Beamline layout

The Nanoprobe beamline is one of the two “long beamlines” being
developed for the Korea-4GSR construction.
