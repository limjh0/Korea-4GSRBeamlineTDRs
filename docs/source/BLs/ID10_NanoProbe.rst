``ID10`` NanoProbe
=================================

1. Introduction
---------------

2. Scientific objectives
------------------------

The nanoprobe beamline provides a nano-beam smaller than 50 nm in the
hard X-ray energy range of 5 to 25 keV. This beam size of 50 nm allows
for quantitative nanoscale analysis of the element distribution and
quantity of materials in localized regions. The energy range of 5 to 25
keV enables quantitative nano-spectroscopy for most transition metals
and rare earth metals. Additionally, the high penetration power of hard
X-rays can pass through gas environments and windows for maintaining
environments. This allows for the study of materials under synthesis and
operating conditions. To facilitate such research, the nanoprobe
beamline is designed to provide a long working distance of 50 mm despite
the small beam size in the tens of nanometer range. This makes it easy
to insert devices that offer various conditions, such as high and low
temperature, gas environments, liquid environment sample delivery, and
the application of electric or magnetic fields, enabling
in-situ/operando materials research. The scientific objectives of the
nanoprobe are on tracking the reactions and defect growth processes of
battery and catalyst systems, and the quantitative nanoscale analysis of
complex functional materials and material systems in actual
manufacturing and operating environments. Also, to accommodate with the
trend of scaling up systems by spreading and stacking nano-components
for enhanced reactivity and performance, we have introduced high-speed
precision nano-stages, allowing us to investigate larger areas at the
nanoscale. The signal recording equipment includes X-ray fluorescence
detectors and signal detectors, providing quantitative simultaneous
information on the electron density, strain, and element distribution of
the sample, with all experiments designed to be studied in three
dimensions.

3. Beamline Requirements for the Insertion Device
-------------------------------------------------

The nanoprobe beamline provides an energy range of 5-25 keV using an
In-Vacuum Undulator(IVU). IDs of Nanoprobe are designed to give the
highest brilliance in this range without losing energy continuity. The
parameters for the IDs are detailed in Table 1. The maximum power
represents the maximum beam power passing through a mask with a 2 x 2
mm² opening @ 23 m under the maximum current conditions(400 mA) [Table
1].

4. Beamline Requirements for the Front End
------------------------------------------

The FE of the nanoprobe beamline is required to 1) handle a 17 kW heat
load, 2) beam position diagnostics, and 3) radiation safety. First, the
17 kW total beam power generated by the IDs is managed using three masks
with water cooled channels. Two of these masks are 'Movable masks' with
adjustable gap sizes and positions, while the third is a 'Fixed mask'
with a fixed aperture size in horizontal direction that can only have
its position adjusted. For detailed specifications of the masks, refer
to Chapter []. Note that although the IDs have a minimum gap of 5 mm,
the effective minimum gap required to provide the 5-25 keV range is 6
mm. Consequently, the effective maximum total power of nanoprobe IDs is
12 kW. Secondly, the FE includes an X-ray beam position diagnostic
device. In the first phase, the diagnostic X-ray beam position will be
used to provide feedback for slits position, ensuring the stability of
the beam intensity delivered to the sample within 10%. In the mature
phase, the diagnostic X-ray beam position will also be integrated with
the electron beam feedback system to enhance performance. For detailed
specifications of the diagnostic device, refer to Chapter []. Lastly,
the FE is equipped with safety devices to protect against gamma
radiation and electron beam insertion in FE. Especifically, a safety
magnet with a strength of 0.5 T is installed to handle scenarios where
the electron beam enters the FE. This ensures that any electron beam
inserted into the FE is deflected horizontally and prevented from
reaching the optical hutch.

[Table 2] Major component list of Nanoprobe beamline

6. Optics Overview
------------------

In this section, we describe the optics and beam specifications of the
nanoprobe beamline. For parameters related to the electron beam, refer
to the chapter []. All optical simulations were performed in ShadowOui
with the OASYS environment. The simulations for the optical components
were primarily conducted at 10 keV, which is expected to be frequently
used, and also at 20 keV for comparison. Note that the X-ray beam source
parameters provided by the OASYS environment do not take into account
the electron energy dispersion. This means that the divergence angle of
the beam is smaller than twice at high energies (high harmonics). Thus,
we use the source parameters provided by SPECTRA as a Geometry source in
OASYS. Also, the coherent length (BDA gap size) and coherent flux
calculations were conducted using homemade code in the Matlab
environment.

[Table 3] The coherence length at the BDA.

[Table 3] shows the coherence length at 10 keV and 20 keV. This
represents the coherence size of the beam focused at the BDA position,
which is a crucial factor for coherence diffraction(scattering)
experiments (e.g., Ptychography, XPCS). [Table 4] shows the coherence
fraction, which is the ratio of the total flux to the coherent flux in a
mono beam. Coherent flux is the flux passing through the BDA when it is
opened to the coherence length. [Figure 2] shows the expected coherent
flux delivered to the sample, taking into account mirror reflectivity,
number of reflections, BDA size, angular acceptance of the nanofocusing
optics, and the polarization effect of the HDCM.

**Consideration for optical layout**

|image3|

[Figure 3] Optical layout of Nanoprobe beamline. M1(High heat load
mirror, Sagittal focusing) and M2(High heat load mirror, Bendable,
meridional focusing) are horizontally reflecting mirrors. HDCM is
Horizontal deflecting Double Crystal Monochromator. SSA is a secondary
source aperture, also called a Beam defining aperture (BDA).

[Figure 3] shows the optical layout of the nanoprobe beamline. The
ultimate goal in designing the layout and specifications of the optical
components is to keep the beam instability delivered to the sample below
10%. To achieve this, we are considering two main aspects. First, the
beamline layout of the nanoprobe beamline incorporates a secondary
source focusing method that enables a flux-versus-resolution trade-off
using the BDA. The optimal position for the BDA is determined by the
coherence length at the BDA position. An optical design with a high
magnification ratio at the BDA allows for a shorter beamline with lower
construction costs. However, the engineering challenge lies in making
controllable apertures smaller than a micrometer. [Table 5] shows the
coherence length and RMS beam size at the BDA for different
magnification ratios. A magnification ratio of approximately 1:1
provides a controllable aperture size. The first optics after the
shielding wall is 29 m from the source, and thus BDA optimal position is
58 m.

different magnification ratios.

Second, the design ensures that the peak heat density on the DCM is kept
below 40 W/mm². This is to prevent thermal bumps and damage of the first
crystal. To reduce the heat density, beamlines of Korea-4GSR adopt two
strategies. The first is to locate the DCM crystal more than 50 m away
from the source. This approach minimizes the number of optical
components. Also, this prevents wavefront distortion caused by
imperfections of mirror surface and beam instability caused by optics
vibrations. However, this strategy cannot optimize the beam flux.
Because it can only accept a limited beam flux that does not cause
thermal bumps. The second is using a High Heat Load Mirror(HHML). This
has the drawback of needing to correct the thermal bump [Figure 4].
Thermal bump correction strategy using a benting pre-focusing mirror can
provide high beam flux above 10\ :sup:`12` phs/s (Coherence flux:
>10\ :sup:`11` phs/s @ 10 keV). One of the objectives of a nanoprobe
beamline is to rapidly investigate a wide sample in nanoscale
resolution, as mentioned in the scientific objective section. To achieve
this, beam flux maximization is necessary. Thus, we have chosen the
second strategy.

[Table 6] M1, M2 mirrors specification

[Table 6] lists the specifications of the mirrors used in the nanoprobe
beamline. The specifications of the M1 and M2 mirrors are designed to
focus the beam on the BDA located at 58 m. The slope error tolerance is
set to ensure that the beam broadens and intensity decreases below 10%.
The M3 mirror is a Nano-KB mirror designed to produce a beam of <50 nm
at energies above 8 keV. The M3 mirror also has less than 10% beam
broadening and intensity decreases with its set slope error and
roughness tolerance. [Figure 5] shows the results of a simulation of the
beam delivered to the sample when these tolerances are met.
