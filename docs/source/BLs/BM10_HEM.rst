``BM10`` High Energy Microscopy (HEM)
=================================

1. Introduction
-------------------

**High-energy microscopy is one of the long beamlines exceeding 100
meters, providing CT images based on projection image technology.
Imaging is performed in a monochromatic beam range of 5 to 40 keV and a
white beam range of up to 100 keV, with photons supplied from a central
bending magnet. The High-Energy Microscopy beamline consists of two
optical hutches and one end station. The first optical hutch is located
in an experimental building (storage building) approximately 27 meters
from the source, and the other two are located in separate buildings at
85 meters and 95 meters, respectively. A separate building is shared
with another long beamline, the ID10 nano-probe beamline.**

2. Scientific objective
-----------------------

**Synchrotron source provide highly brilliant and collimated X-rays,
which are essential for achieving high-resolution imaging.
Microtomography (μCT) using synchrotron radiation has significantly
advanced the nondestructive three-dimensional imaging capabilities
across various scientific disciplines such as medicine, biology, and
materials science. Superior imaging capabilities allow for detailed
studies of internal structures such as porosity, grain morphology, and
defects without destructive sample treatment. The transition from
incoherent to coherent X-ray sources will open up new scientific
discoveries and possibilities in medicine, biology and materials
science.**

1. **Improved Contrast and Resolution Imaging**

**Synchrotron-based μCT continues to evolve with advancements in X-ray
sources and imaging techniques. Due to the divergence of the incoherent
X-ray source, the spatial resolution achievable in the tomogram is
limited to about 2 μm. Increasing the coherence of the X-ray beam is
expected to significantly improve spatial resolution. Phase contrast
imaging utilizes increased photon flux and coherence ratio to improve
spatial resolution and contrast. This technique improves sensitivity to
structural changes in the specimen while minimizing its impact on the
sample. Improved spatial resolution and sensitivity allow researchers to
resolve finer structural details in three-dimensional imaging, expanding
the range of observations in materials and biological specimens.**

2. **4D Materials Science (Dynamics study of in-situ/operando)**

..

   **Imaging beamlines utilizing 4th generation light sources can be
   optimized for performing μCT on bulk samples. Enhanced photon flux
   and contrast improve acquisition times for dynamic imaging,
   supporting rapid data acquisition for materials modeling and
   validation. This enables real-time 3D imaging (4D) of materials
   behavior, facilitating direct comparison between experimental and
   simulated data.**

3. **Multiscale Imaging**

..

   **Multiscale imaging provides wide spatial resolution in absorption
   and phase contrast imaging, enabling detailed studies of
   microstructures ranging from hundreds of nanometers to several
   millimeters. This approach implies a comprehensive understanding of
   material structures and processes.**


3. Beamline Requirements for the Insertion Devices (Bending magnet)
---------------------------------------------------------------

**High-energy microscope beamlines require high-brightness sources that
can cover the X-ray energy spectrum from 5 keV to over 100 keV and small
source sizes to maximize phase contrast effects. To meet these
requirements, bending magnets or superbend magnets are needed that can
provide high fields at short device periods.**

**Bending magnets are essential components of synchrotron facilities
used to steer electron beams along circular paths, and the performance
of the magnets is critical to the overall functioning of the beamline in
terms of brilliance and flux. Figures 1 and Table 1 illustrate the
brilliance and flux curves for bending magnets, showing their
capabilities at various photon energies.**

| magnet      |             |              |             |             |
+-------------+-------------+--------------+-------------+-------------+

**Bending magnets have magnetic fields as high as 2 Tesla, with a
critical energy of 21 keV and a usable energy range of up to 100 keV.
The extended energy range covering up to 100 keV supports a wide array
of experimental techniques and applications, including studies of dense
materials and high-energy processes. High flux and brightness enable
more detailed, higher resolution imaging and analysis, which are
essential for advancements in materials science, biology, and
chemistry.**

**Bending magnets can be upgraded to superbend magnets in the future to
provide an immediate improvement in beamline performance while
preserving the existing beamline design. Superbend magnets are
specialized magnets designed to enhance the performance of synchrotron
beamlines by generating higher flux and brilliance, particularly at
higher photon energies. High photon energy allows for more accurate and
detailed investigations in various scientific domains such as imaging,
X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS), and scattering. We anticipate
meeting future scientific requirements by keeping open the option to
upgrade our imaging beamline.**

4. Beamline Requirements for the Front End
----------------------------------------

**The layout of the beamline is split into two parts separated by a
ratchet-shaped storage ring tunnel wall, and the inside of the ring
tunnel wall is the front-end (FE). The FE is designed to protect both
personnel and equipment on the beamline, as well as the machinery in the
event of a vacuum failure on the beamline.**

**The HEM beamline requires a new high heat load front end capable of
handling a total power of 1.36 kW with a beam divergence of 2.0 mrad
horizontally and 0.3 mrad vertically.** **The front end of the HEM
beamline is designed to respond to beamline issues while minimizing
entry and exit. Table 2 shows an overview of the components and
functions of the HEM beamline front end.**
