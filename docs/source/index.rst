Korea-4GSR Beamline TDRs
========================

`The Korea fourth-generation storage ring <https://kps.kbsi.re.kr/>`_ (**Korea-4GSR**) is a new synchrotron radiation facility under construction in Ochang, Chungbuk, South Korea. 
The new ring is designed as a *multipurpose* synchrotron radiation source that aims to achieve both academic excellence and industrial benefits.

This website is created to assist the Beamline Science Team of the 4GSR Research Division at `the Pohang Accelerator Laboratory <http://pal.postech.ac.kr>`_ in authoring technical design reports (TDRs) for the first phase beamlines at Korea-4GSR. Snippets of beamline TDRs will be compiled regularly to facilitate effective communication among participating authors.
