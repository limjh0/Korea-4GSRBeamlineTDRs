Korea-4GSR Beamline TDRs
========================

The Korea fourth-generation storage ring (**Korea-4GSR**) is a new synchrotron radiation facility currently under construction in Ochang, Chungbuk, South Korea. It is designed as a *multipurpose* synchrotron radiation source that aims to achieve both academic excellence and industrial benefits. The facility will operate at an electron energy of 4 GeV, which can produce a wide range of X-rays from soft to hard X-rays. The target emittance is 62 pmâ‹…rad, which is
about 100 times smaller than the emittance of `the Pohang Light Source-II (PLS-II) <http://pal.postech.ac.kr/>`_ in South Korea.
